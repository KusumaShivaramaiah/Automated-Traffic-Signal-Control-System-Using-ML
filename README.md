"# Automated-Traffic-Signal-Control-System-Using-ML#" 
This project aims to develop a sophisticated traffic light control system using Python code and machine learning techniques. By analyzing images of traffic lanes, the system calculates the density of vehicles in each lane, assigning priorities to emergency vehicles, particularly ambulances. Furthermore, it dynamically adjusts traffic signal timings based on the real-time density of vehicles in each lane, optimizing traffic flow and ensuring efficient traffic management
